              <p>This process takes the massive administrative pain out of immigration, and replaces it with an easy way for employers to choose and get the talent they need. It puts the decisions directly in the employer's hands.It shows that the govt. trusts businesses to find talented people. </p>

              <h3> The assessment by the immigration team </h3>
              <p>Extensive chats with steppan gave us insight into the process. Those guys take an incredibly holistic approach when analysing business. They look at x y and z - even if a business is running at a loss, or the founders have been bankrupted, that business can still be considered “financially sound”. They take painstakingly analyse each and every case. This lets the outliers pass, give examples:</p>

              <p>Stephan identified a gap where companies don’t even know this scheme exists (needs further research), or that it can be a far more efficient process
              He felt that businesses are often unaware of the wiggle room encompassed by “financially sound”, and that people avoid applying because they don’t want to share that they are running at a loss.
              Another painpoint is in the process itself - there are no examples of what an application should look like, which leads to applicant confusion.
              If the business isn’t applying now, they aren’t gathering the info they need in a format that they could for a future application

              <h3>Data management</h3>
              <p>
              Right now, there are 48 employees in this process, and 530 accredited companies. That’s a 1 : 10 ratio of worker per company! Already the system is strained, it’s definitely not scalable to the thousands of companies that are eligible for this process.

                mikeys story- Tech companies need to be able to choose what skilled meen. since many people in tech dont qualify for visas in a traditional stream, the buisness accredditation process is currenly the best policy to get them a visa. The best way for the tech sector to decide what a skillset means is to put the power in their hands. This is where the employer accrediation comes in. Accredited employers get to choose

            <p>
              Gabrielle, Connor, and Ashlyn have worked together before as a team winning ‘Most innovative use of Landcare Research data” with the app, TreeHugger, at NatureHack sponsored by Landcare Research. During this 24 hour hackathon, we collectively slept 6 hours. If you can still produce an award winning app, and be friends during and after, you know you’ve got a solid team.

            <h4 class="teal"><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> We can talk to each other and talk to computers. <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></h4>
            <p>
              We’re great at communicating directly and honestly with each-other, both in reigning in each others’ overly outrageous ideas, and culling them completely and are supportive, and enabling for each other. We are all open communicators who speak our minds. this means we have a team that gets things done and are totally open with each other. Between us, we’ve struck a fantastic dynamic.
